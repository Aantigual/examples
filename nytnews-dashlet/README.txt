This is a sample Sugar 7 dashlet that renders results of an ajax call using the current record context. The specific example is doing a New York Times news search on the name of the current record, rendering it in the dashlet as an iFrame.

You can take this, zip it up, and install it in your Sugar 7 instance. But mostly, it's designed as a starting point for building your own Sugar 7 iFrame dashlet.

Enjoy!
